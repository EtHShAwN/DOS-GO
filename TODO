# DOS-GO Documentation

## Overview

This project is a simple DOS emulator that can run your DOS program from command line without launching any Virtual Machine.

## Features

1. **Load Our Program** - [Working]
   1. Analyze the executable header
   2. Allocate sufficient memory for the program
   3. Emulate soft & hard interrupts
      - **Todo**: Load .EXE files is not supported yet

2. **Execute Every Machine Code** - [Working]
   1. `mov` instruction
   2. `add` instruction
   3. `jmp` instruction

3. **Graphics Program** - [Not Yet Implemented]

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Load Our Program

When the emulator starts, it performs the following steps:

- **Analyze the Executable Header**: 
  - Reads the header of the executable file to understand its structure and required resources.
  
- **Allocate Sufficient Memory for Program**: 
  - Reserves memory space (640KB) needed for the program's execution based on the information obtained from the header.
  
- **Emulate Interrupts**: 
  - Sets up a basic system for handling interrupts, allowing the program to request services from the operating system (or emulator).

> **Note**: Only .COM file is support Now. Support for loading .EXE files is currently under development.

### 2. Execute Every Machine Code

The core functionality of the emulator includes the ability to interpret and execute specific machine code instructions:

- **MOV Instruction**: 
  - Implements moving data between registers and memory locations.

- **ADD Instruction**: 
  - Supports addition operations between different registers.

- **JMP Instruction**: 
  - Provides the capability to jump to different code segments within the program.

### 3. Graphics Program

Currently, the graphics functionality is not implemented. Future work may include:

- Rendering simple graphics or text-based user interfaces.
- Implementing graphical output capabilities to enhance the usability of the emulator.
